# CITRIC
ChaIning TRansformations Information Coverage - Automated Selection of Optimal Model Transformation Chains via Shortest-Path Algorithms

## Project Composition
In the / resources folder there are all the elements that allow to evaluate and replicate the running example described in the article.
Specifically we have:
* [Metamodels](resources/running_example/metamodels) - All the metamodels used in the running example (taken from the ATL Zoo);
* [Transformations](resources/running_example/transformations) - All the transformations used in the running example (taken from the ATL Zoo);

In the results folder we have the execution chains results organized in folders (one for each chain in the example):
* C1
* C2
* C3

In the models folder there are some models used as input test and the folders of:
* mutations - in which there are all the models mutations organized by KM3 metaclasses;
* Sample-km3 - in which there is the seed model taken as sample for the running example input.
