Metamodel files
---------------
 * UMLDI.xmi
 * Amble.ecore
 * Amble.km3

Example files
-------------
 * Semaphore.xmi: input UML model (produced with Poseidon For UML CE 3.0)
 * sem-amble.ecore: corresponding Amble model
 * Semaphore.ml: Amble program corresponding to the generated Amble model
 * Query.topo: Amble topography corresponding to the generated Amble model
 * Answer.topo: Amble topography corresponding to the generated Amble model

Transformation files
--------------------
 * UML2Amble.atl

"UMLDI.xmi" and "Amble.ecore" are the metamodels for UML and Amble models.
The Km3 file provides a readable version of the Amble metamodel in the km3 format.

The UML2Amble transformation ("UML2Amble.atl") can be tested with the UML model ("Semaphore.xmi") as input.
It returns an Amble model ("sem-amble.ecore").

"Semaphore.ml", "Query.topo" and "Answer.topo" respectively provide the corresponding textual Amble program and Amble topography files.
They are generated by means of 2 distinct extractions from the Amble model to text:
  - Amble2Code produces "Semaphore.ml"
  - Amble2Topos produces "Query.topo" and "Answer.topo"
These steps are not detailled in this example.
