 * ATL-0.2.ecore
 * ATL-0.2.km3
 * Problem.ecore
 * Problem.km3

Example files
-------------

Transformation files
--------------------
 * ATL2Problem.atl

"ATL-0.2.ecore" and "Problem.ecore" are the metamodels for ATL and Problem models.
Km3 files provide readable versions of these metamodels in the km3 format.

The ATL2Problem transformation ("ATL2Problem.atl") can be tested with the ATL model ("test-ATL-0.2.ecore") as input.
It returns a Problem model ("atl-problem.xmi").

"test.atl" provides a readable version of the ATL example.
Note that an ATL model (".ecore") can be generated from an ATL file (".atl") by means of the "Inject ATL-0.2 file into ATL-0.2 model" contextual menu of the Megamodel Resource Navigator (see http://eclipse.org/gmt/).
