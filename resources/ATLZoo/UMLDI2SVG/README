To run the UMLDI2SVG ATL transformation example you have to :
	- Create launch configurations (see screenshots in ProjectConfiguration/)
	- Run UMLDI2SVG in the first place
	- Then run SVG2XML (to have a model ready to be serialized)
	- Eventually, run XML2Text, once you have configured in the XML2Text.atl code
	  the output path (first line of the query).
