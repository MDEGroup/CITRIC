Metamodel files
---------------
 * KM3.ecore
 * KM3.km3
 * Problem.ecore
 * Problem.km3

Example files
-------------
 * test.km3: the KM3 metamodel test file
 * test-KM3.ecore: the corresponding KM3 model
 * problem.xmi: the Problem model generated from the KM3 model

Transformation files
--------------------
 * KM32Problem.atl

"KM3.ecore" and "Problem.ecore" are the metamodels for KM3 and Problem models.
Km3 files provide readable versions of these metamodels in the km3 format.

The KM32Problem transformation ("KM32Problem.atl") can be tested with the KM3 model ("test-KM3.ecore") as input.
It returns a Problem model ("problem.xmi").

"test.km3" provides a readable version of the KM3 source metamodel (textual format).
This file has to be injected into a KM3 model to produce the test KM3 model ("test-KM3.ecore").
